## Log in to the server host as a user with root access (sudo).

## Download ice-cfd-server-installer.tgz to /tmp/.

cd /tmp
curl https://.../ice-cfd-server-installer.tgz


## Unpack the intaller in the /tmp directory, make sure that it is readable to
## all users.

cd /tmp
tar xzf /tmp/ice-cfd-server-installer.tgz
ls -l ice-cfd-installer
chmod a+rX ice-cfd-installer


## Run script to install system dependencies (as root).

sudo /tmp/ice-cfd-installer/install-dependencies.sh


## Create an un-privileged user named e.g. "cfd" and \become\ this user.

sudo useradd -u 4000 -m -s /bin/bash -g users cfd
sudo su - cfd


## Define the cfd-server installation root and run the install script.
## The install.sh script must be run from the installer directory.
## This will take time and involves downloading and compiling software.

mkdir ~/cfd-server
export CFD_SRV_HOME=~/cfd-server
cd /tmp/ice-cfd-installer/ice-cfd-installer
./install.sh


## Read the information at the end of the installation output and finish by
## executing the final step as root. First log out to the privileged user,
## then, using sudo to gain root privileges, define the installation directory
## as before and run the root fix script.

exit && whoami
sudo sh -c 'export CFD_SRV_HOME=~cfd/cfd-server && /tmp/ice-cfd-installer/singularity/fix-singularity-suid.sh'


## Log back in as the cfd user and test some aspects of the installation. All
## tests must be OK.

sudo su - cfd
/tmp/ice-cfd-installer/test-installation.sh


## Then try to start and stop the servers as the cfd user

cfd-servers-start.sh


## And stop the servers

cfd-servers-start.sh stop
